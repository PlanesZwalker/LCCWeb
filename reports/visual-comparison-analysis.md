- Reduced visual impact

## 📐 **3. Layout Organization & Spacing**

### What Was Better in Iteration 3:
- **Improved Spacing**: Better use of whitespace and padding
- **Enhanced Grid System**: More refined layout proportions
- **Better Visual Balance**: Improved element distribution
- **Consistent Margins**: More uniform spacing throughout

### Current Issues:
- Tight spacing in some areas
- Inconsistent margins
- Less refined layout proportions

## 🔘 **4. Button Styling & Interactions**

### What Was Better in Iteration 3:
- **Enhanced Button Design**: More sophisticated button styling with better gradients

- Reduced hover effect impact
- Missing visual feedback refinements

## 💬 **5. Chat Bubble Design & Readability**

### What Was Better in Iteration 3:
- **Enhanced Bubble Design**: More refined chat bubble styling
- **Better Typography**: Improved text readability and hierarchy
- **Enhanced Visual Separation**: Clearer distinction between different message types
- **Improved Content Layout**: Better organization within chat bubbles

### Current Issues:
- Less refined bubble styling
- Typography could be improved
- Reduced visual separation between elements

## 🔮 **6. Glass Morphism Effects & Transparency**

### What Was Better in Iteration 3:
- **Stronger Glass Effects**: More pronounced backdrop-filter effects
- **Better Transparency**: Optimized opacity levels for better readability
- **Enhanced Blur Effects**: More sophisticated blur implementations
- **Improved Layering**: Better use of z-index and stacking context

### Current Issues:
- Reduced glass morphism impact
- Less sophisticated transparency effects
- Missing advanced blur implementations

## 📝 **7. Typography & Text Hierarchy**

### What Was Better in Iteration 3:
- **Enhanced Font Hierarchy**: Better distinction between different text levels
- **Improved Readability**: Optimized font sizes and weights
- **Better Text Contrast**: Enhanced text-background contrast
- **Refined Font Spacing**: Better letter-spacing and line-height

### Current Issues:
- Less refined typography hierarchy
- Reduced text contrast in some areas
- Missing typography refinements
