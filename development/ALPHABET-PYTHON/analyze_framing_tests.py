    CRITICAL FRAMING ANALYSIS: Evaluate this camera framing test for the Ultimate Cascade Render project.
    
    FRAMING EVALUATION CRITERIA (Rate each 1-10):
    
    1. CHARACTER VISIBILITY (CRITICAL - 30% weight):
       - Are letters A, B, C clearly visible and identifiable?
       - Are their colors (red, pink, green) clearly distinguishable?
       - Are eyes, mouths, and limbs visible on all characters?
       - Are characters properly sized and positioned in frame?
    
    2. WATERFALL VISIBILITY (CRITICAL - 25% weight):
       - Is the waterfall clearly visible and prominent?
       - Is it properly positioned in the frame?
       - Does it have good visual impact?
       - Is the water pool visible?
    
    3. PAGODA VISIBILITY (CRITICAL - 20% weight):
       - Is the pagoda/temple clearly visible?
       - Is it properly positioned and sized?
       - Does it contribute to the scene composition?
    
    4. ENVIRONMENT BALANCE (15% weight):
       - Are trees, ground, and clouds visible?
       - Is the environment well-balanced in the frame?
       - Does it provide good context and depth?
    
    5. COMPOSITION QUALITY (10% weight):
       - Is the overall composition balanced and professional?
       - Are elements properly spaced and positioned?
       - Does the camera angle work well for the scene?
    
    TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT:
    - Image clarity and sharpness
    - Lighting quality and shadows
    - Color balance and saturation
    - Overall technical quality
    
    PROVIDE:
    - Overall framing score (1-10)
    - Character visibility score (1-10)
    - Waterfall visibility score (1-10)
    - Pagoda visibility score (1-10)
    - Environment balance score (1-10)
    - Composition quality score (1-10)
    
    SPECIFIC FEEDBACK:
    - What works well in this framing?
    - What needs improvement?
    - Would this framing work for the final render?
    
    BE BRUTALLY HONEST. This will determine the final camera position for 100% success.
