    CRITICAL TASK: Analyze this camera test render for the Ultimate Cascade Render project.
    
    EVALUATION CRITERIA (Rate each 1-10):
    
    1. CHARACTER VISIBILITY (CRITICAL):
       - Are letters A, B, C clearly visible and identifiable?
       - Are they properly sized and positioned?
       - Are their colors (red, pink, green) clearly distinguishable?
       - Are eyes and features visible?
    
    2. WATERFALL VISIBILITY (CRITICAL):
       - Is the waterfall clearly visible?
       - Is it properly positioned in the frame?
       - Does it have good prominence?
    
    3. ENVIRONMENT VISIBILITY:
       - Are trees and ground elements visible?
       - Is the overall scene well-framed?
    
    4. COMPOSITION QUALITY:
       - Is the overall composition balanced?
       - Are elements properly spaced?
       - Does the camera angle work well?
    
    5. TECHNICAL QUALITY:
       - Is the image clear and well-lit?
       - Are there any technical issues?
    
    PROVIDE:
    - Overall score (1-10)
    - Specific strengths of this camera position
    - Specific weaknesses or issues
    - Recommendations for improvement
    - Would this position work for the final render? YES/NO
    
    BE BRUTALLY HONEST. This will determine the final camera position for 100% success.
